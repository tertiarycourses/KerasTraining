# Step 1: Preprocess data

# Load the image file, resizing it to 224x224 pixels (required by this model)
img = image.load_img("../images/car-224.jpg", target_size=(224, 224))

# Convert the image to a numpy array

# Step 2: Load Pre-trained Model

# Load Keras' VGG16 model that was pre-trained against the ImageNet database
#model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=True, input_tensor=None, input_shape=None)
#print(model.summary())

# Scale the input image to the range used in the trained network

predictions = model.predict(x)

# Look up the names of the predicted classes. Index zero is the results for the first image.
